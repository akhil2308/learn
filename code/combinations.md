# Part 1: Combinations (Subsets)
This Python program generates all possible combinations (subsets) of characters from a given string using **bitwise operations**. Letâ€™s break down its working step by step.


```python
def generate_combinations(s):
    n = len(s)
    combinations = set()
    for i in range(1 << n):  # Iterate through 0 to 2^n - 1
        subset = ""
        for j in range(n):
            if i & (1 << j):  # Check if the j-th bit is set
                subset += s[j]
        combinations.add(subset)
    return sorted(combinations, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))

# Example usage:
input_str = "abc"
print("Combinations for", input_str)
print(generate_combinations(input_str))
```

### **1. Understanding the function**
```python
def generate_combinations(s):
```
- This function takes a string `s` as input.
- It will generate all possible subsets (combinations) of the characters in `s` and store them in a **set** to avoid duplicates.

---

### **2. Determining the number of subsets**
```python
n = len(s)
```
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- Since each character can either be **included or excluded** in a subset, the total number of subsets is **\(2^n\)** (including the empty set).

---

### **3. Looping through all possible subsets**
```python
for i in range(1 << n):  # Iterate through 0 to 2^n - 1
```
- `1 << n` is **bitwise left shift**, equivalent to \(2^n\).  
  For example, if `s = "abc"`, then `n = 3`, so `1 << n` gives \(2^3 = 8\), meaning `i` will iterate from **0 to 7**.

- The loop iterates through **all numbers from 0 to \(2^n - 1\)**. Each number represents a **unique subset** of `s` by treating its binary representation as a selection mask.

---

### **4. Extracting subsets based on bits**
```python
subset = ""
for j in range(n):
    if i & (1 << j):  # Check if the j-th bit is set
        subset += s[j]
```
- We initialize an empty string `subset` for each iteration.
- The inner loop checks each bit of `i`:
  - `1 << j` creates a bitmask with the **j-th bit set**.
  - `i & (1 << j)` checks whether that bit is set in `i`.
  - If it is set, we **include** `s[j]` in the subset.

---

### **5. Storing unique subsets**
```python
combinations.add(subset)
```
- Each generated subset is added to a **set**, ensuring uniqueness.

---

### **Example Execution for `s = "abc"`**
#### **Binary Representation of `i` and Corresponding Subset**
| `i` (Decimal) | `i` (Binary) | Included Characters | Subset |
|--------------|------------|--------------------|--------|
| 0 | `000` | (empty) | `""` |
| 1 | `001` | `c` | `"c"` |
| 2 | `010` | `b` | `"b"` |
| 3 | `011` | `b, c` | `"bc"` |
| 4 | `100` | `a` | `"a"` |
| 5 | `101` | `a, c` | `"ac"` |
| 6 | `110` | `a, b` | `"ab"` |
| 7 | `111` | `a, b, c` | `"abc"` |

---

### **Final Output**
```python
input_str = "abc"
print("Combinations for", input_str)
print(generate_combinations(input_str))
```
Output:
```plaintext
Combinations for abc
{'', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'ab', 'ac', 'bc', 'abc'}
```
**Note:** The order of the elements in the set may vary because sets in Python are unordered.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- The **outer loop** runs \(2^n\) times, representing all subsets.
- The **inner loop** checks which bits are set in `i` to determine subset elements.
- The **set** ensures unique subsets.
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \cdot 2^n)\) since each of the \(2^n\) subsets is generated by iterating over at most `n` elements.

Would you like me to modify this program to return subsets in sorted order? ðŸš€
